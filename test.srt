00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,415
[The Wolf]

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,440
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,679
Ma Jing, I know you're worried that

4
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,439
Zhai Xing might be sad,

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,840
but she needs to

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,560
know the truth.

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Castellan!

8
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,520
Sorry for my incompetency!

9
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,400
General!

10
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Brother!

11
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,839
Wolfie,

12
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
I hope every couple in the world

13
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,520
ends up like us.

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
I hope they can be honest
with each other.

15
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,799
And have their happily ever after.

16
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:45,880
Xing Er,

17
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,520
time to sleep.

18
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,760
Carry me back then.

19
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,040
Okay, I'll carry you back.

20
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,480
Ma Zhai Xing,

21
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,719
see you on the battlefield.

22
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,959
[It's time for me]

23
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
[to pay with my life.]

24
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,640
Ma Troop, listen up!

25
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,480
General Ma Feng Cheng

26
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,559
had passed away!

27
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:08,519
Stop!

28
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
Why are you sneaking around?

29
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,519
He must be Chu Kui's spy!

30
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,679
He's trying to

31
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,760
report General Ma's passing to them.

32
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,519
Get down!

33
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,679
You!

34
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,439
What else did you tell them?

35
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
You guys will never win!

36
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:29,480
Tell us!

37
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,040
Did you tell them that

38
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:31,999
Ma Troop knew the truth

39
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:32,959
about the murder of Ma family?

40
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,679
This...

41
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,679
What should we do?

42
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,239
Maybe he has told them

43
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,920
about General Ma's attempt to rebel.

44
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,999
If Chu Kui knows about this,

45
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,920
he will stop Zhai Xing from coming.

46
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
But they need at least one day

47
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,760
before they can receive
the pigeon's letter.

48
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,160
I think Zhai Xing

49
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
still has time to leave.

50
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,239
It's just that

51
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:00,880
we must be quick.

52
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,760
We need to meet her before anyone else.

53
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,439
Princess,

54
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:10,839
time to depart.

55
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,160
Strange.

56
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,239
Why isn't His Highness sending me off?

57
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,160
Princess,

58
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,519
Lord Bo

59
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,519
was summoned by His Majesty
this morning.

60
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,439
That's why he couldn't send you off.

61
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,839
Tell Lord Bo to

62
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
wait for my return.

63
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Princess,

64
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
have a safe trip.

65
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,959
Please take care of yourself.

66
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,679
You guys take care as well.

67
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:10,959
I'll leave now.

68
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,679
Princess.

69
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,839
Master,

70
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,360
Princess has departed.

71
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,199
From this moment onwards,

72
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,560
Ma Zhai Xing and I
will go on our separate ways.

73
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,399
Our ties are severed.

74
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,879
If we meet on the battlefield,

75
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,440
we'll see if Ma Zhai Xing

76
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,319
was blessed by the heavens.

77
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,639
Yes, Lord Bo.

78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,759
Enter the palace.

79
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,399
Ma Jing,

80
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,120
are you okay?

81
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,120
I'm fine.

82
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,279
If I can't confirm

83
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,639
Princess's safety personally,

84
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,639
I won't be able to face my dead brother.

85
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,480
Fine.

86
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,440
The imperial army can reach

87
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,000
the Ma Troop's camp in many ways.

88
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,000
We'll split up into three groups.

89
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,399
You two,

90
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,719
follow Ma Jing

91
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,759
and search in the north.

92
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,399
The other two should
take the mountain path.

93
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,839
I'll take the main path.

94
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,759
Send us a smoke signal

95
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,079
if you find anything!

96
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,839
-Yes!
-Yes!

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Master, what's wrong?

98
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,759
How's the progress?

99
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,879
Ma Zhai Xing is on her way now.

100
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,920
I've investigated the path she's using.

101
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,839
My men are following her as well.

102
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,639
We'll poison her
when we have the chance.

103
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,040
You mustn't fail.

104
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,440
Yes, Master.

105
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,519
It's you?

106
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:45,959
The antidote!

107
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,959
You're trying to poison Zhai Xing
behind His Majesty's back.

108
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,120
Do you think

109
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,079
His Majesty will release you?

110
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,600
I'll tell His Majesty

111
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,440
about your misdeed right away.

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
Damn it!

113
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,639
Your Majesty.

114
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,040
Father.

115
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,079
Lord Bo,

116
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,600
you...

117
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,040
You came at the right time!

118
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,879
The spy I planted in Ma Troop

119
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,639
sent us news.

120
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,719
He said Ma Troop

121
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,160
had found new evidence

122
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
and they knew that I was the one

123
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,719
who ordered
the assassination of Ma Ying!

124
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
They intend to stage a revolt.

125
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,839
But...

126
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,959
But this is strange.

127
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,199
Why aren't they moving

128
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,759
when they're trying to

129
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,000
stage a revolt?

130
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm sure

131
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,199
they're waiting for
Ma Zhai Xing to arrive

132
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,680
before they act.

133
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
Capture Ma Zhai Xing immediately.

134
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,279
Father,

135
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,759
I just came back from Yao Ji's cell.

136
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
Yao Ji ordered her men

137
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,440
to poison Ma Zhai Xing on her way there.

138
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,920
Ma Zhai Xing must be safe!

139
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,879
She's my hostage now!

140
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,079
I need her to stay alive!

141
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,079
Bring Night Fury
and stop Ma Zhai Xing immediately!

142
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
Bring her back!

143
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,120
Yes, Father.

144
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,600
Let's take a break.

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,759
We'll go to Taibao Battalion later.

146
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,879
Sir, what would you like?

147
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,600
Give me the best tea.

148
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,120
And some snacks.

149
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,199
Sure, please have a seat.

150
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Please have a seat.

151
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,560
Sit down.

152
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes, Princess.

153
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,079
Is there no one

154
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,240
willing to sit with me?

155
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,719
Princess, we're low-rank troops.

156
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,079
It's unsuitable for us to sit together.

157
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,160
Fine.

158
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,040
I won't force it since you guys

159
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,319
are so disciplined.

160
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,160
Sir,

161
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,079
your snacks.

162
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,519
And your tea.

163
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:31,800
Thank you.

164
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,440
Please enjoy.

165
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,759
The carriage is ready.

166
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:54,800
Prepare to depart!

167
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,319
Let's take a look inside.

168
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:06,719
Yes.

169
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,040
Let's depart!

170
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,719
Miss Ma Jing,

171
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,639
there's no one inside.

172
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:39,480
Get on the horse!

173
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,120
Ma Jing!

174
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:48,399
Princess?

175
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,279
Ma Jing!

176
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,160
Princess!

177
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,839
Princess!

178
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,440
I've finally found you!

179
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:02,920
Is it really you?

180
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,719
Were you alone?

181
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,600
Lord Bo sent his men to escort me.

182
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,719
Just now,

183
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,000
I wanted them to stop.

184
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,519
I wanted to see if you were there.

185
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,560
I didn't expect them

186
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,879
to tell me to move along

187
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,800
and not waste any time.

188
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:17,879
Do you know this?

189
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,519
I lied to them.

190
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,759
I told them I had a stomachache.

191
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,240
And I asked them to wait for me.

192
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,719
We shouldn't stay here!

193
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,560
Let's leave!

194
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,199
Hurry!

195
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,759
Hurry! Get on my horse!

196
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,600
Wait.

197
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,560
Hurry! Follow me!

198
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,600
Ma Jing, what's going on?

199
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,680
I'll tell you everything

200
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,600
when we're safe.

201
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,279
Ma Jing,

202
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,680
what exactly is going on?

203
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,920
Princess,

204
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,399
you must be prepared for the news

205
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,120
that I'm going to tell you right now.

206
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,560
Ma Jing,

207
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,759
why are you wearing this attire?

208
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,240
Don't tell me...

209
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,440
My brother...

210
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,959
He had passed away.

211
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:04,639
Ma Jing,

212
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,440
let's return to Ma Troop's camp.

213
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,680
I want to send Brother Feng Cheng off.

214
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,440
Stop!

215
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,040
Surround them!

216
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,959
Princess Ma,

217
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,240
you're not allowed to leave.

218
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,160
You guys misunderstood us!

219
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,639
Ma Jing is my family!

220
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,079
Princess,

221
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,879
I'm sure Lord Bo

222
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,199
sent them to kill us.

223
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:29,719
What are you saying?

224
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Why is Lord Bo trying to kill us?

225
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,000
Kill Ma Zhai Xing!

226
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,360
Stop!

227
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,040
Leave Ma Zhai Xing alive.

228
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,680
His Majesty has an order.

229
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,200
Bring her back to the Imperial City.

230
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,560
Who are you?

231
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,759
Arrest her!

232
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,840
Who are you?

233
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,840
Why are they following your orders?

234
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,440
No.

235
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,279
They aren't Lord Bo's men at all.

236
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,160
They're just impersonating them!

237
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,200
Lord Bo

238
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,680
did send them here!

239
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,200
Because

240
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,279
King of Jin

241
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,840
isn't the one who wiped out your family!

242
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,599
It's Chu Kui

243
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,840
and Lord Bo!

244
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,840
Impossible.

245
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,840
Impossible.

246
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm sure Lord Bo isn't the culprit.

247
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,359
Who exactly are you?

248
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,479
Not every woman

249
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
can make me care for them.

250
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,800
Even if they're my consorts.

251
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,680
It's all because you're Ma Zhai Xing.

252
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:50,440
Are you still Wolfie?

253
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,519
I will always be Wolfie in front of you.

254
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,999
Heavens, thank you
for bringing us together.

255
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,279
And make us love each other.

256
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,279
Why?

257
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,519
Why?

258
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,720
Under His Majesty's order,

259
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,479
I'm here to arrest the criminal,
Ma Zhai Xing.

260
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:33,519
Take her away.

261
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,239
Hold it right there!

262
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,960
Princess!

263
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,359
Stop!

264
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,759
-Stop!
-Princess!

265
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,359
Hold it right there!

266
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,920
Ma Zhai Xing,

267
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,160
I will tell you everything

268
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,279
that you want to know.

269
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,399
But do you have the courage

270
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:13,999
to bear the truth?

271
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,519
Why did you

272
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,279
kill my entire family?

273
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,320
Why did my father do wrong?

274
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,399
He protected the borders
and stayed in the army his entire life.

275
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm sure

276
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,080
this is a misunderstanding.

277
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,759
I'm sure you weren't

278
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,840
the one who wiped out my family.

279
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,599
I'm sure it's the King of Jin,

280
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:45,999
am I right?

281
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
The truth is Ma Ying's merits
were too great for his own good.

282
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,399
The truth is

283
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,279
I sent you to the battlefield

284
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,879
because His Majesty wanted to kill you

285
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,119
and the entire Ma Troop.

286
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,279
The truth is

287
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,879
the man you love

288
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,320
is a tool of your father's killer!

289
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,239
As long as I can be with you,

290
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,160
I don't care about anything else.

291
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,840
Even if your love is fake.

292
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,440
If I could pretend,

293
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,840
I hope that

294
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,720
the misdeeds that I've committed

295
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,960
haven't happened at all.

296
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,279
But when you say that

297
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,279
you want a pure relationship

298
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,399
without any lies,

299
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,720
I realized that

300
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,040
I can't do it.

301
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,080
What did he use you for?

302
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,359
A weapon for war.

303
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,080
Princess, you may

304
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,720
know Wolfie well,

305
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,399
but you don't know Lord Bo at all.

306
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,239
When I return to the Court,

307
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,359
I'm not Wolfie anymore.

308
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,759
I'm Lord Bo.

309
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,239
She said

310
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,960
we were cursed by the heavens.

311
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,879
And that we will never be together.

312
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,160
I often think that

313
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,440
it would be better for me

314
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,720
to end my life by jumping off the cliff.

315
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,119
Don't tell me there's an ambush?

316
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,519
What if I were the ambush?

317
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,359
If you and I fight,

318
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,080
it means that Wolfie is dead.

319
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,759
Only Lord Bo is left.

320
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,239
The truth is

321
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,519
Wolfie and Xing Er

322
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,519
will never be together!

323
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:38,680
The truth is

324
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,040
you and I

325
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,680
were cursed by the heavens!

326
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,080
The truth is

327
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,239
I still hope that

328
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,879
you're lying to me even when
we're in this state!

329
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
Arrest Ma Zhai Xing and Ma Jing.

330
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:22,279
Bring them back to the Capital.

331
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,440
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

332
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,639
How dare you

333
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:22,080
try to poison His Majesty's hostage?

334
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,359
Stay put with your master.

335
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,960
His Majesty has no time for you two now.

336
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,040
You two should reflect on your actions.

337
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,800
And wait for His Majesty's punishment.

338
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:35,960
Master.

339
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,879
How's the situation?
Do you have any news?

340
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,639
After Ma Troop

341
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:42,879
knew the truth about
the murder of Ma family,

342
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,999
they tried to stage a revolt.

343
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,720
Ma Zhai Xing was captured by Lord Bo.

344
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,399
Now, she's the hostage of His Majesty.

345
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,119
Lord Bo didn't let her go?

346
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,440
No.

347
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,080
He treats her like a criminal.

348
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,599
Now, they're enemies.

349
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,200
This is their cursed fate
from the start.

350
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,960
The true Lord Bo will awaken soon.

351
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,040
Soon.

352
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,040
The true Lord Bo will return soon.

353
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,920
He will require my assistance.

354
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,759
Seems like we'll be out soon.

355
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,080
It's our brothers from Ma Troop!

356
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,840
Search the front!

357
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:30,800
-Yes!
-Yes!

358
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,680
What happened?

359
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,759
Princess!

360
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,519
Lord Bo took Princess away!

361
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,200
We were too late.

362
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,879
What are we waiting for?

363
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,359
Attack the Capital

364
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,119
and save Princess!

365
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:56,720
No!

366
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,479
Now, our forces are weak.

367
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,399
We're no match for Lord Bo.

368
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,200
And we can't save Zhai Xing

369
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,279
and Ma Jing without a plan.

370
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,359
What should we do if Chu Kui

371
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,440
does kill Princess?

372
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,080
Although they've exposed our plan,

373
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,920
Zhai Xing

374
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,759
is still of use to Chu Kui.

375
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,200
As long as Chu Kui

376
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,119
has Ma Zhai Xing in his hand,

377
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,399
the Ma Troop will behave themselves.

378
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,519
Chu Kui

379
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:24,599
will certainly suppress us

380
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,359
with every chance he gets.

381
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,160
Let's return to our camp

382
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,879
and form a plan.

383
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,080
Return to the camp!

384
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,479
Princess!

385
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,119
Don't touch me.

386
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
Let go of me!

387
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,800
Let go of me!

388
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,800
I can walk by myself!

389
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,359
Let me out!

390
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,160
You liar! Let me out!

391
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,040
Princess!

392
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,519
Princess treated you guys well,
you know?

393
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:50,800
How can you guys

394
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,399
be so cruel and unscrupulous?

395
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,599
All of you are worse than dogs!

396
00:28:57,879 --> 00:28:58,759
You're right.

397
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,040
I'm speechless.

398
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,160
Hai Die!

399
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,560
I treated you

400
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,800
as my best friend, you know?

401
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,879
You and Lord Bo,

402
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,200
how could you two be the ones

403
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,599
behind Castellan's death?

404
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,119
How could you guys

405
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,840
do such a cruel thing?

406
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,759
Just treat it as if

407
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,519
you knew the wrong person.

408
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,519
Come back!

409
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,200
Come back!

410
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,160
Keep watch over them.

411
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
I'll report to Master.

412
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,040
Mo Xiao,

413
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,239
I have questions for you.

414
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,320
Princess.

415
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,639
Is Lord Bo really the one

416
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,639
who wiped out my family?

417
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,759
That damned Ma Troop!

418
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,359
One step is all I need

419
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,279
for me to succeed!

420
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,160
But...

421
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,440
But everything went wrong

422
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,359
in the last step!

423
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,639
They even joined the Jin Troop?

424
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,080
This is great!

425
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,920
Jin got our Ma Troop

426
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,800
without any effort!

427
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,720
But you were able to sever your ties

428
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,720
with Ma Zhai Xing

429
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,320
and bring her back to me.

430
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,639
Lord Bo,

431
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,200
I will compensate you

432
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,440
in the future.

433
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,239
Ma Troop

434
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,119
had joined Jin.

435
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,160
The most important thing now

436
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
is to use Ma Zhai Xing

437
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,359
to control Ma Troop

438
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,560
so that Jin doesn't dare
to act recklessly.

439
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,999
Ma Troop

440
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:06,320
is a huge boost to the strength

441
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
of Jin Troop.

442
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,279
That King of Jin,

443
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,200
he'll try everything to save

444
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:14,999
Ma Zhai Xing in order to

445
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,200
gain the favour of Ma Troop.

446
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,999
Lord Bo, ask your guards

447
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,160
to guard over her.

448
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,960
No mistakes are allowed!

449
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,560
Yes.

450
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,840
Ma Zhai Xing is still poisoned.

451
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,119
At this very moment,
she's the most important

452
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,080
hostage we have.

453
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,359
She must be safe.

454
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,080
You're right.

455
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,759
Zhang Jin!

456
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,399
Before I put Yao Ji in jail,

457
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,800
I forced her

458
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,680
to give me the antidote.

459
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,960
I knew

460
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,040
this would happen.

461
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,800
Here.

462
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,840
Go and neutralize the poison
in her body.

463
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,680
Yes, Father.

464
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,560
Master,

465
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,999
Ma Jing and Princess

466
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:19,879
are in prison now.

467
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:21,759
This is the antidote.

468
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:22,800
Put an adequate amount

469
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
in her food or water.

470
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,239
And let Ma Zhai Xing consume them.

471
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,519
Remember,

472
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,999
you must keep the poison

473
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,119
a secret from her.

474
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,879
According to her personality,

475
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,999
she won't follow your instructions.

476
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:33,920
Yes.

477
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,680
Master,

478
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,759
aren't you going to visit her?

479
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,840
She's a hostage and a criminal.

480
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,560
There's no need for me to visit her.

481
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,599
Have some food.

482
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,200
So nice?

483
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,399
Did you poison the food?

484
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,359
I won't commit

485
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,239
such an atrocious act.

486
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:37,399
Yeah.

487
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,960
You're only good at

488
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,160
slaughtering people in the dark.

489
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,279
Get out!

490
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,519
I don't want to see you!

491
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,920
Eat while it's hot.

492
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,119
Scram!

493
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,960
Close the door.

494
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,399
If you hurt Princess,

495
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,119
I won't let you off

496
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,320
even if I become a ghost!

497
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,160
Princess, time to eat.

498
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,480
I want to see Lord Bo.

499
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,000
Princess,

500
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,440
drink it while it's hot.

501
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,480
Princess!

502
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,319
I want to see Lord Bo!

503
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,879
Did they bully you?

504
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,559
I will prepare a new one for you.

505
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,319
Princess!

506
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,359
I'll say this again.

507
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,760
Bring me to Lord Bo!

508
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,319
Princess, calm down.

509
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,799
Princess,

510
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:07,799
put down the shard.

511
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,200
I'll bring you to Master.

512
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,559
Here, give me the shard.

513
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,359
I promise I'll bring you

514
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,399
to Master.

515
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,879
I promise.

516
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,000
Princess,

517
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,960
you're no match

518
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,599
for us.

519
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,559
Why are you doing this?

520
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,079
I told you I want to see Lord Bo!

521
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,839
Don't you understand me?

522
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,799
I understand.

523
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,599
I'll report to Master immediately.

524
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,799
She insisted on seeing you.

525
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,440
She even tried to hurt herself.

526
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,359
She was injured by accident

527
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:59,559
when I try to

528
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,399
snatch away the shard from her.

529
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:06,160
Is it serious?

530
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,280
Just some minor cuts. Nothing serious.

531
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,520
This is the remaining antidote.

532
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,240
I'll return it to you.

533
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,760
The problem is

534
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,399
Princess

535
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,440
hasn't consumed the food yet.

536
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
The poison is still in her body.

537
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,599
Master,

538
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,440
shouldn't you visit

539
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,319
Princess?

540
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,280
Under what identity?

541
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,039
As Wolfie?

542
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,440
Or as Lord Bo who broke her heart?

543
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,480
But...

544
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:42,680
I will beg Father

545
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,440
to let Ma Zhai Xing go.

546
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,119
And I will trade one life for another.

547
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,399
Master,

548
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,160
how are you going to do that?

549
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,960
I'll let Zhai Xing kill me personally

550
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,520
in order to avenge her family.

551
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,920
This is the best way

552
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,119
for me to atone for my sins.

553
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,720
And it's the best ending

554
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,119
for both of us.

555
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:15,720
Master!

556
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,599
Hai Die.

557
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,240
Master,

558
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,280
aren't you going to

559
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,879
visit Princess tomorrow?

560
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,039
Let me think about it.

561
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,319
I still have some antidote left.

562
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,839
[Xing Er,]

563
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,440
[I could only neutralize your poison]

564
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,319
[by bringing you back.]

565
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,839
[I will make sure you're safe.]

566
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,000
His Majesty ordered us
to assassinate them!

567
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,319
But he's blaming

568
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:10,960
Master

569
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,920
for their deaths!

570
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,039
Why is he doing this?

571
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,440
But isn't it the same

572
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,639
if we do

573
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,399
the dirty deeds for Master?

574
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:24,760
I dare to say this.

575
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,559
I'm sure Master
has always been thinking about this.

576
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,760
Maybe,

577
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,920
he has been thinking about

578
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,839
using his life to atone

579
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:33,440
for his sins

580
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:35,760
ever since

581
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,520
he gave Princess

582
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,119
the wolf bow.

583
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,319
Princess!

584
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:56,119
Why do you look so pale?

585
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
Are you hurt?

586
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm fine.

587
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,160
Ma Jing, dress her wound.

588
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,960
This...

589
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,839
How did you

590
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,760
get such a big cut on your hand?

591
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,200
Does it hurt?

592
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,399
It doesn't.

593
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,520
Just tell me if you're in pain!

594
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,399
Please don't keep it to yourself!

595
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,639
Silly girl, why are you crying?

596
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
My hand doesn't hurt at all.

597
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,480
You're lying!

598
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,520
You're a human!

599
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,200
I'm sure it hurts!

600
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
I'm in pain when I look at it!

601
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,520
Princess!

602
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,480
Ma Jing, don't cry.

603
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,319
Don't cry.

604
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,399
Don't cry.

605
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,520
According to reports,

606
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,079
Chu Kui built many

607
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,760
underground cells that are
unknown to people.

608
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,520
It's hard for us to identify

609
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,760
the exact cell that Princess is in.

610
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,119
And now, I'm sure Chu Kui

611
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,839
has handed over the defence

612
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,559
to Lord Bo.

613
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,280
So, the current Yang Palace

614
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,599
is impenetrable.

615
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,480
We can't even enter the palace.

616
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,879
How could we save Princess?

617
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,240
Since we can't enter the palace,

618
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,960
we'll force them

619
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,359
to hand her over then.

620
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:22,599
Fourth Prince,

621
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,280
according to our current speed,

622
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,359
we can reach the Capital

623
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,879
within half a day.

624
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,520
Fourth Prince?

625
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,440
What did you say?

626
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,319
Fourth Prince, if you're tired,

627
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,599
we should take a break

628
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,359
at the stop in front of us.

629
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,280
We can continue tomorrow.

630
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,799
I'm not tired.

631
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,440
I was just wondering why

632
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,000
Father

633
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,079
didn't let us stay

634
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,000
and attack the Taibao Battalion.

635
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,839
Instead, he wants us

636
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,760
to return to the palace.

637
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,119
I don't know what His Majesty
is planning as well.

638
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,240
But I'm sure

639
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,200
His Majesty has his own concerns.

640
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,359
Do you think Father is doing this

641
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,039
because he thinks that
I will spoil his plan?

642
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:00,879
If that's the case,

643
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,079
why would His Majesty

644
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,720
ask you to do a reconnaissance
of the Taibao Battalion

645
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,639
in the first place?

646
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:07,039
Your Highness,
you're overthinking things.

647
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,720
Cousin, you're right.

648
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
But this time, I've helped Father

649
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,599
to complete a mission.

650
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,720
Say, do you think

651
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,119
Third Brother will
see me in a different light?
